## How to make a new Release

1. Update version number in package.json (follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)) in an extra commit
1. Merge the Pull Request with that commit
1. Tag the commit with the new version number on master locally and push the tag to GitHub
1. Travis-CI pushes the new Version to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-wikibase)
1. On GitHub create a new "[Release](https://github.com/wmde/wdio-wikibase/releases)" for the tag with information on what changed
